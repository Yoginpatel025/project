            <h1>The Ocean</h1>
            <p>The ocean covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface, making it the largest habitat on the planet.</p>
            <p>It plays a crucial role in regulating the climate by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Oceans are home to a vast array of ecosystems, from coral reefs to deep-sea trenches, supporting diverse marine life.</p>
            <p>They provide vital resources such as food, medicine, and minerals, sustaining billions of livelihoods worldwide.</p>
            <p>Human activities like overfishing, pollution, and climate change threaten the health of our oceans and marine biodiversity.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Marine life, or sea life or ocean life, is the plants, animals, and other organisms that live in the saltwater of the sea or ocean, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms produce oxygen and sequester carbon. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.</p>
